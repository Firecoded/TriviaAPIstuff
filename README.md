# TriviaAPIstuff

> Small project I put together in preperation for a hackathon that involved APIs. Had a an idea and ran with it.
>Although simple I've found a lot of people spend a lot of time playing around with it.
>I'd like to revisit it someday to add some extra features, until then enjoy.

### How

>Project is written with Javascript, html, css and jQuery. Api is pulled via Ajax call.
>The API pulls three wrong answers and a right answer. Those variables are stored then grouped into an array and shuffled.

### Future/Issues

>The project was something fun but not a serious app I would continue but who knows.
>Features that wouldn't be too difficult to add would be an interval to skip to the next question after a correct answer.
>I would like to also improve the scoring feature a correct a bug that allows you to inflate your score.
>More advanced features could be a high score feature and interactive multiplayer.
