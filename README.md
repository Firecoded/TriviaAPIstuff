# TriviaAPIstuff

> Small project I put together in preperation for a hackathon that involved APIs. Had a an idea and ran with it.
>Although simple I've found a lot of people spend a lot of time playing around with it.
>I'd like to revisit it someday to add some extra features, until then enjoy.

### How

>Project is written with Javascript, html, css and jQuery. Api is pulled via Ajax call.
>The API pulls three wrong answers and a right answer. Those variables are stored then grouped into an array and shuffled.

### Future/Issues

>The project was something fun but but could use some polish in the future.
>Some features I would like to introduce would be, auto question skip, time limit/improved scoring, multiplayer and high score.
